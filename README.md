Idea 1 : Social network

      Aka Social Data Acquisition and Social Graph Processing

      Today, social networks are the first choice for marketing campaigns. They promise to serve well targeted, viral, highly customizable       advertisement while getting direct customer feedback and engagement. The numbers generated by the Internet companies serving digital       advertisements are astronomical: Google $43B (2012), Facebook $6B, etc…

      In this context of online marketing through social networks, the tasks of this project are split in two parts, the first being more       pragmatic (hands-on) and the second more theoretical:

      Social Data Acquisition
      Crawl a number of public APIs (Facebook, G+, Twitter, etc…)
      Store the data in a database
      Build a web interface to search through the data
      Social Graph Processing
      Starting from one given node in the graph (i.e. a particular company), the social graph will be quantified and analyzed.
      The different data sources (Facebook, Twitter, etc…) will be correlated to discover non obvious links (like sister entities, etc…)         and interactions
      For instance A always retweet B which always retweet C; A, B and C are part of the same cluster
      The goal of the project is to quantify and classify the marketing footprint of companies on social networks.

      The student choosing this project will have the opportunity to acquire in-depth hands-on experience on state-of-the-art APIs,             storage (graph or NoSQL database), graph processing and data mining.
      
Idea 2 : 
      You have StackOverflow data available online (I would recomment exporting it from Google Platform), you can try to derive some             statistics form it (like average score per comment or something more fun, up to you), implement it either with different framework         or     with Spark but with different api (DataFrames API, SQL, DataSets, RDD, etc) and deploy it on any PAAS that you think is             popular (the       major 3 are AWS, Google and Azure). This will give you enough work to actually understand how it all works and it       will help you to         hold a reasonable discussion during interviews.
